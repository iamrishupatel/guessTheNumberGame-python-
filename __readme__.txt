Hey I am rishu patel and this repository contains the code for all the versions of my guess the number game.
I made this game  while i was learning python.
So as I learnt python I updated my game.
I hope You like it <3.

__Differences in all version__
Didn't know git back then...

--v1.0--
very simple just asks the user to guess the number and
congratulates if user is right. otherwise tells to guess again.

--v1.1--
The only difference between v1.0 and v1.1 that it tells the user how much difference is there between 
guess number and secret number.
eg.
If the the difference between guessNumber and secretNumber is More then it tell that secret number is 
much smaller/bigger other wise bit smaller/bit bigger

--v1.2-- 
Just added a tuple of secret number so that user can continue playing
if he/she wants.
PS. - I didn't know about random library back then.

--v1.3--
Created more levels in the game with some level having limited chances to guess the number.


#Till now there was a issue that if user enter anything other
#than integers then programm wil break.
#so I fixed it in v1.4

--v1.4--
My favorite one.
1.Uses random library to generate random secret number.
2.Uses functions
3.Uses Try Except Block to avoid unwanted Error.
4.Has 2 levels. Normal(Unlimited chances) and Hard(20 chances)
5.And Above all its much cleaner, readable & understandable.
